Due to having tearing issues (mainly in Slack, terminal and others) I investigated
and apparently there is a generic Xorg driver for all the 2D stuff, which means I
don't have to use the buggy Intel driver, xf86-video-intel

1. Add i915 driver to Early KMS Start

In order for the Kernel Mode Setting stuff (that is basically getting the gpu driver
into kernel space, for faster term swtiching and full framebuffer nice things in the
ttys) we have to:

- Add "i915" to the FILES line in /etc/mkinitcpio.conf
- Rebuild the initramfs: mkinitcpio -p linux

2. Remove the old driver and config

That is just:

- pacman -R xf86-video-intel
- rm -rf /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/20-intel.conf

For reference, this was the 20-intel.conf's contents:

Section "Device"
        Identifier      "Intel Graphics"
        Driver          "intel"
 	#Option 		"SwapbuffersWait" "true"
   	Option 		"AccelMethod"  "sna"
        Option          "TearFree" "true"
EndSection

3. Reboot and done

This fixes all tearing and weird artifacts. It did though make urxvt (and xterm) crash
the system. This was fixed at the end by updating the bios to A07 (on the XPS13).
