Linux by default thinks all mouses are 1000dpi. To change that, add a file 
to the udev hwdb, e.g. for the Razer DeathAdder, add

mouse:usb:v1532p0029:name:Razer Razer DeathAdder:
  MOUSE_DPI=2500@1092

To /etc/udev/hwdb.d/71-mouse.hwdb

And then do

sudo udevadm hwdb --update

## Update May 2017

As of May 2017 and after rebooting mouse was very slow. Removed the file and ran
again udevadm. Now works well. Maybe this is now fixed OOTB??

## Second Update May 2017

Apparently after using the mouse on Windows the mouse is stuck in high DPI mode,
and if I use on the desktop linux then on low DPI.
