In case due to some hardware issue you can't wait for the Arch
people to build a patched kernel, there is an AUR linux-mainline
package with the latest upstream version.

There is even an unofficial repo source with compiled packages.

[miffe]
Server = http://arch.miffe.org/$arch/

Then you can just do

pacman -S linux-mainline

There are some fixes needed in order to get it all running, as:

- Virtualbox

Rebuild the virtualbox kernel modules. In order to do this, just
reinstall the `virtualbox-guest-dkms` package. Then reload any
needed modules (check `sudo modprobe vbox*` and `TAB`)
