My system swaps too much important program memory, so things slow down and
are unresponsive on high ram loads. In order to prevent so much swapping
change the vm.swappiness sysctl param to 10, 1 or even 0 (default 60).

In the same way, the kernel tends to reclaim memory used for inode cache
too eagerly, making browsing the fs too slow. Change the mv.vfs_cache_pressure
sysctl param to something like 50 (default 100).

To have both persist reboot, add to /etc/sysctl.d/99-sysctl.conf

vm.wrappiness=1
vm.vfs_cache_pressure=50
